		<ul>
			<li>Where did she go and when?</li>
			<li>Is there a pattern in her travels?</li>
			<li>Where are certain flora located?</li>
			<li>What were her most active years?</li>
			<li>What places did she visit the most?</li>
			<li>What were the most and least common flora?</li>
			<li>Is there a way we can evaluate by genus instead of species?</li>
			<li>Where in the collection is this flora (regarding page and volume number)?</li>
			<li>Did her attention to detailed recording vary over time?</li>

		For our project, we're thinking about doing one "super-visualization" with many features. The main interface includes a map of Maine, a slider for selecting date ranges, a searchable dialog box, and a "town inspector" box. The goal of this visulization is to be able to explore when and where Furbish found specific flora. By walking through each of the possible interactions, the functionality of each of these should become clear:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			The year slider allows a user to select a range of years that they want to explore. Only samples that occured within that range will appear in the visualization.
		</li>
		<li>
			The search box has two tabs: one for searching by AH Scientific name, and the other for searching by common name. The user can search for a flora by name, and then check any results that they want to visualize (a picture of the flora from the collection may appear as well). Whenever a flora is checked, a dot will appear at all of the towns in which that flora was sampled (within the specified year range). If there is already a dot there (i.e. there has already been a flora checked with a sample there), the dot will increase in size. There will also be away to select or deselect all flora.
		</li>
		<li>
			If the user clicks on a town, the inspector box will populate with information about all of the checked flora that have samples in that town. For each type of flora, the user will be able to see both the scientific and common names, the volume and pages in which it appears within the collection, the total number of samples, and the years in which the flora was sampled in that town.
		</li>
		<li>
			Clicking on a town will also bring up a zoomed in image of the town and the area around that the user can augment.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Questions we have decided to pursue</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Where did she go and when?
				<ol><li>This can be seen through the year scale and the dots on the map</li></ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Where are certain flora located?
				<ol><li>Seen through searching for flora and seeing where they appear</li></ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Where in the collection is this flora (regarding page and volume number)?
				<ol><li>This information will appear in the town inspector box</li></ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Where did she find the most flora?
				<ol><li>Can be seen by selecting all flora and checking the size of the dots</li></ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
