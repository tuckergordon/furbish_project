	<hr/>
	<p>
	Our dataset is the Kate Furbish Collection. In our dataset, each row represents an entry that is on a specific page in a volume of the collection of her illustrations. Each of these entries has 5 categorial attributes:
	<ul>
		<li>Volume</li>
		<li>KF Scientific Name</li>
		<li>KF Scientific Name [revised]</li>
		<li>AH Scientic Name</li>
		<li>AH Common Name</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	It also has one real attribute, which is the dimensions of the illustration.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to these, each entry can have up to 9 sets that indicate the location and year that the specimen was documented.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our work, we plan on working with all of the attributes, with the exception of the dimensions.
