	<h3>General Description and Interactions</h3>
	<p>For our project, we are doing one "super-visualization" with many features. The main interface includes a map of Maine split by towns, a slider for selecting date ranges to examine, a searchable dialog box for both scientific and common names, and a "town inspector" box. The goal of this visulization is to be able to explore when and where Furbish found specific flora. By walking through each of the possible interactions, the functionality of each of these should become clear: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The year slider allows a user to select a range of years that they want to explore. Only samples that occured within that range will appear in the visualization.</li>
		<li>
			The search box allows for searching by AH Scientific name, and by common name. The user can search for a flora by name, and then check any results that they want to visualize. Whenever a flora is checked, a dot will appear at all of the towns in which that flora was sampled (within the specified year range). If there is already a dot there (i.e. there has already been a flora checked with a sample there), the dot will increase in size. There is also be a way to select or deselect all flora.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Goals by date</h3>
	<strong>Week 1 (Nov. 13-19)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Brainstorm questions and visualizations</li>
			<li>Write write-ups</li>
			<li>Clean data (get rid of typos)</li>
			<li>Read in and parse data</li>
			<li>Communicate plans/ideas for visualizations with Kat</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<strong>Week 2 (Nov. 20-26)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Finish parsing data</li>
			<li>Sophie and Marcus create map of Maine with dots on towns that have samples of currently selected flora</li>
			<ul>
				<li>i.e. Sophie makes a choropleth for a proof of concept that we have a map that dynamically represents user flora selection and where the samples of selected flora were taken. Marcus makes a map where there are dots at the geographic center of each town.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Tucker researches search mechansims and implements one</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<strong>Week 3 (Nov. 27 - Dec. 3)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Whoever isn't debugging gets the zoom functionality to work on the map so that the user can zoom in on a particular town to gain more information regarding that respective town. </li>
			<li>Make dots increase in size to reflect aggreate data (so integrating Sophie's and Marcus' components, then embelleshing)</li>
			<li>Tucker and Sophie implement tooltips and visual indicators for when user hovers over a town or dot. This will allow the user to click on exactly what they want to click on. </li>
			<li>Tucker will design final layout for when all parts are integrated. If possible, the group will then begin to integrate search box with map visualization</li>
			<li>Start week 4 tasks if possible</li>
		</ul>	
	<br>
	<strong>Week 4 (Dec. 4-10)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The group will finish integrating the search dialog and map tool.</li>
			<li>Build town inspection box and integrate with map and search box</li>
			<li>Give dots and towns functions that when clicked, change what infomation is displayed in the town inspection box, and zoom in if the user has not done so already.</li>
			<li>Marcus adds in slider (should be just copy and pasting)</li>
			<li>Prepare and give presentation</li>
		</ul>		
	<br>
	<strong>Week 5 (Dec. 11-18)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Implement feedback from classmates</li>
			<li>Finish inspection box</li>
			<li>Debug and clean code</li>
			<li>Make everything look better!</li>
		</ul>
