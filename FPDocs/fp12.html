	<h3>Goals by date</h3>
	<strong>Week 1 (Nov. 13-19)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Brainstorm questions and visualizations</li>
			<li>Write write-ups</li>
			<li>Clean data (get rid of typos)</li>
			<li>Read in and parse data</li>
			<li>Communicate plans/ideas for visualizations with Kat</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<strong>Week 2 (Nov. 20-26)</strong>

			<li>Finish parsing data</li>
			<li>Sophie and Marcus create map of Maine with dots on towns that have samples of currently selected flora</li>
			<ul>
				<li>i.e. Sophie makes a choropleth for a proof of concept that we have a map that dynamically represents user flora selection and where the samples of selected flora were taken. Marcus makes a map where there are dots at the geographic center of each town.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Tucker researches search mechansims and implements one</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<strong>Week 3 (Nov. 27 - Dec. 3)</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Whoever isn't debugging gets the zoom functionality to work on the map so that the user can zoom in on a particular town to gain more information regarding that respective town. </li>
			<li>Make dots increase in size to reflect aggreate data (so integrating Sophie's and Marcus' components, then embelleshing)</li>
			<li>Tucker and Sophie implement tooltips and visual indicators for when user hovers over a town or dot. This will allow the user to click on exactly what they want to click on. </li>
			<li>Tucker will design final layout for when all parts are integrated. If possible, the group will then begin to integrate search box with map visualization</li>
			<li>Start week 4 tasks if possible</li>
