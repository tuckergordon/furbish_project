	Our project focuses on the dataset created from Bowdoin's collection of Kate Furbish's botanitcal drawings. Kate Furbish was a botanist from Brunswick, Maine.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> She lived from 1834 to 1931.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Her dilligent, prolific cataloging of the flora of Maine while defying gender norms of her time marks Furbish as one of the unsung heros of botany. Her work is now largely curated at Bowdoin College, and can be seen on dipslay in Hawthorne-Longfellow Library. Our project uses a dataset that holds information on each sample in her catalogues, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Location and year</li>
		<li>Common and scientific labels (current and at time of discovery)</li>
		<li>Dimensions of drawing of sample</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Questions that you could use to the dataset to answer</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Where did she go and when?</li>
			<li>Is there a pattern in her travels?</li>
			<li>Where are certain plants located?</li>
			<li>What were her most active years?</li>
			<li>What places did she visit the most?</li>
			<li>What were the most and least common plants?</li>
			<li>Is there a way we can evaluate by genus instead of species?</li>
			<li>Where in the collection is this flower (regarding page and volume number)?</li>
		</ul>
