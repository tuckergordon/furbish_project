	<h3>Progress on Goals:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Very productive meeting with Kat Stefko</li>
		<ul>
			<li>We discussed the current questions we were asking to see if she thought they were all relevant, and if there was anything we missed. She was satisfied, though had some additional questions that the dataset didn't have the capacity to examine (e.g. what path did Kate Furbish take) or wouldn't be best shown in a dynamic visualization (e.g. how did Kate Furbish's level of meticulousness vary over the years in her records).</li>
			<li>We showed her our current design to see if this tool would optimally facilitate her research from a historian point of view. She is not able to offer a botanist point of view as she is a Special Collections librarian, but if we have more questions about the horticultural point of view, she is happy to connect us with staff at the Maine Botanical Gardens. She found our visualization satisfactory.</li>
			<li>She gave us some of Furbish's drawings in case we want to include them in our visualization.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Cleaning data</li>
			<ul> 
				<li>Looking through the data, we have found hundreds instances of misspellings, gaps, and inconsistencies in how certain types of information are written (several different people have been involved in transfering Kate Furbish's work to an excel file, and they have used different methods to record that information). Due to the uniqueness of most of the errors, we had to go through the existing data by hand, making changes to any misspellings and standardizing how the information is recorded. This will allow us to parse the data much more easily and succesfully.</li>
				<li>We weren't expecting the dataset to need so much modification, so as she cleaned it, Sophie created 5 different versions of the file so the original was preserved and changes could be tracked easily.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Reading in and parsing data</li>
		<ul> 
			<li> As this is a large data set, we wrote a script that will parse the data and organize it in a format that we can use during the project. We are thinking of creating both flower and town structs to store the data, so during the parsing process, we will be creating a new instance of a flower struct whenever we encounter a new species of flora and a new instance of a town struct when we encounter a new town. To the flower struct, we will append:
			
			<ul>
				<li> The volume it was found in, and on what page it was found. </li>
				<li> The scientific name of the flora. </li>
				<li> The revised scientific name of the flora. </li>
				<li> The AH scientific name. </li>
				<li> The AH common name.</li>
				<li> The towns in which this species was found.</li>
				<li> The number of instances of this flora was found. </li>
				<li> When the flora instances were found. </li>
			</ul>

			To the town struct, we will append:

			<ul>
				<li> The name of the town </li>
				<li> The flora that were found in that town </li>
				<li> The number of each of the flora that were found in that town </li>
				<li> The volume the flora were found in, and on what pages they were found. </li>
				<li> When the flora instances were found. </li>
			</ul>	

			</li> 
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h3>New Questions/Issues:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Is it possible to get images of the flowers to learn when the user selects one? After our conversation with Kat, it seems like this actually could be possible, though it might be out of the scope of this project.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr/>
	<h3>Most Immediate Goals for the Following Week:</h3>
	<ul>
			<li>Finish parsing data</li>
			<li>Sophie and Marcus create map of Maine with dots on towns</li>
			<li>Marcus adds in slider (should be just copy and pasting)</li>
			<li>Tucker looks for search mechanisms and starts trying to implement one</li>
		</ul>
